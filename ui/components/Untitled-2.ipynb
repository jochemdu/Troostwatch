    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covered the essential aspects of using Tesseract OCR with Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installation & Setup**: Install `pytesseract` and ensure Tesseract is available on your system\n",
    "2. **Basic Extraction**: Use `image_to_string()` for simple text extraction\n",
    "3. **Configuration**: Tune PSM and OEM modes for different document types\n",
    "4. **Region Extraction**: Crop and process specific areas of interest\n",
    "5. **Bounding Boxes**: Get detailed location and confidence data for detected text\n",
    "6. **Multi-language**: Support for multiple languages with the `lang` parameter\n",
    "7. **Preprocessing**: Improve accuracy with grayscale, thresholding, denoising, and scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always preprocess images for better results\n",
    "- Use appropriate PSM mode for your document type\n",
    "- Scale images to ensure adequate DPI (300+ recommended)\n",
    "- Check confidence scores to identify low-quality detections\n",
    "- Consider using region-based extraction for structured documents"
