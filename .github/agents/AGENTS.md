# Agent Instructions Scope for `.github/agents/`

These instructions govern the files in this directory. Keep one canonical file per
role (API, docs, lint, tests) inside this folder and do not duplicate them in
other repository paths. When updating a role file, remember its scope is limited
to this directory tree; ensure the file location matches the intended scope.
